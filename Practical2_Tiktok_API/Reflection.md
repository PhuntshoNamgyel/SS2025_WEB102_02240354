# Social Media RESTful API Reflection

## Main Concepts Applied

In this practical, I designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for a social media platform using Node.js and Express. Key concepts applied include:

- **RESTful API design** - Following best practices for URI design and using correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Content negotiation** - Supporting multiple response formats based on client requests
- **Error handling** - Implementing proper error catching and response mechanisms
- **Status codes** - Using appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- **Modular project structure** - Organizing code into separate folders for maintainability
- **Middleware implementation** - Custom middleware for error handling, response formatting, and async functions
- **Resource management** - Creating endpoints for users, posts, comments, likes, and followers

## What I Learned

I learned how to structure a backend API project from scratch using Express:

### Project Organization
- The importance of keeping code organized using separate folders for controllers, routes, middleware, and utilities
- How to create a scalable and maintainable project structure

### API Development Skills
- Gained practical experience in defining clean and meaningful routes for different resources
- Implemented content negotiation to support multiple response formats
- Learned to simulate data using mock files before connecting to a database

### Documentation and Best Practices
- How to document APIs using simple HTML files
- Understanding of RESTful design principles and their real-world application

## Conclusion

This practical helped me understand the full process of designing and building a RESTful API. Key achievements include:

- Learning to set up a clean, well-structured backend project
- Mastering proper route structure and organization
- Handling requests and responses in a consistent and secure way
- Gaining confidence in using Express to build scalable APIs
- Applying industry best practices in a real project context

Overall, this practical provided valuable experience in backend API development and strengthened my understanding of RESTful architecture principles.
